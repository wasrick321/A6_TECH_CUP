 A6 DEX — Class A6 Technical Cup Project

📌 About the Project

A6 DEX is a creative, interactive web application developed as part of the Technical Cup competition by students of Class A6 (CSE Branch).

Inspired by the Pokédex concept, this project represents our class as a collection of unique digital characters. Each character reflects a real classmate, showcasing their strengths, personality, achievements, and memorable traits in a fun yet structured way.

This project is sponsored by Class A6 itself, built to creatively present our batch while applying modern web development practices.

🎯 Project Theme

> “Every classmate is unique — A6 DEX documents that uniqueness.”



The idea behind A6 DEX is to transform a traditional class introduction into a gamified digital experience, where students are displayed as characters under different categories.

🗂️ Categories

Profiles are organized into four major categories, each representing a different aspect of student life:

Achievers

Sports

Academic Performance

Fun Moments


Each category contains multiple character profiles representing our classmates.

Each character profile includes a combination of structured and creative details such as:

Basic identity details
